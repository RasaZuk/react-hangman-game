## Project Name

# Hangman game

Project Title: 📛

About the Project: 📚
This project was a homework for my Programing course built with React, JavaScript and CSS.
Currently the game is for Lithuanian speaking friends, but I have a willing and intention to upgrade it into english for a bigger mass of players.
It is not only a game, but also has an educational purpose for practising capitals of the world.
